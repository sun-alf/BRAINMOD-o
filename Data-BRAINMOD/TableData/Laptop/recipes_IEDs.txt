      Emergency Flare  or  Emerg.Flare taped]
  Modified Flare = [Sticky Det.(Timed)  +
      Emergency Flare  or  Emerg.Flare taped]
  Modified Walkman = [Walkman  +  Detonator (Timed)]
  Modified Walkman = [Walkman  +  Sticky Det.(Timed)]
  Tube/Primer= [Detonator (Timed)  +  Steel Pipe]
  Tube/Primer= [Sticky Det.(Timed)  +  Steel Pipe]

Chemistry:
  Sodium Hypochlorite= [Toilet cleaner  +  Glass Jar]
  Hydrochloric Acid  = [Hydrochloric Acid  +  Glass Jar]
  Sulfur Trioxide    = [Sulfur Trioxide  +  Glass Jar]
  White Phosphorous  = [White Phosphorous  +  Glass Jar]

Booby traps:
  Can with String = [String  +  Soda Can]
  Can with String = [String  +  Empty Can]
  Boobytrap (Flare) = [Tripwire  +  Modified Flare]
  Boobytrap (Klaxon)= [Tripwire  +  Modified Walkman]
  Boobytrap (Impact)= [Tripwire  +  any hand grenade]

Cocktails:
  Alcohol-Oil Mix = [Oil  +  Bottle of Alcohol]
  Alcohol-Oil Mix taped= [Duct Tape  +  Alcohol-Oil Mix]
  Gasoline-Oil mix = [Oil  +  Tank of Gas]
  Molotov Cocktail = [Rag  +  Alcohol-Oil Mix]
  Molotov Cocktail = [Rag  +  Alcohol-Oil Mix taped]
  Improvised Chlorine Gas Grenade = [Glass Jar + 
      Sodium Hypochlorite + Hydrochloric Acid]
  Improvised Smoke Gas Grenade    = [Glass Jar +
      Hydrochloric Acid + Sulfur Trioxide]
  Improvised WP Grenade           = [Glass Jar +
      White Phosphorous  +  Rubber Band]

Improvised Exploding Devices (IED, bomb):
  Pipebomb C1 = [C1 small Charge  +  Tube/Primer]
  Pipebomb C4 = [C4 small Charge  +  Tube/Primer]
  Flarebomb = [Alcohol-Oil Mix  +  Emerg.Flare taped]
  Flarebomb = [Alcohol-Oil Mix taped  +  Emergency Flare]
  Flarebomb = [Alcohol-Oil Mix taped  +  Emerg.Flare taped]
  Flarebomb = [Emergency Flare  +  Alcohol-Oil Mix taped]
  Flarebomb = [Emerg.Flare taped  +  Alcohol-Oil Mix]
  Flarebomb = [Emerg.Flare taped  +  Alcohol-Oil Mix taped]
  Fertilizer Bomb = [Fertilizer  +  Tank of Gas]
  Eagle Screamer = [Tear Gas Grenade  +  Gasoline-Oil mix]
  Eagle Silencer = [Stun Grenade  +  Gasoline-Oil mix]
  Eagle Fearball = [Frag. Grenade  +  Gasoline-Oil mix]
