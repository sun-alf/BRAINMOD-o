Each <File> tag represents an additional file, up to 100 files can be added. Each file takes fileId ("ubCode" code in LUA
function "AddFilesToPlayersLog") automatically, starting from ID 100, if tag <File> formed propely.

File attributes:

    Name: in-game displayed name of file

    Path: Local (relative) path to file in your file system. Game looks for your file starting in:
        /path_to_your_JA2/Data-your_mod/TableData/Laptop/
        I.e. if you put "<Path>X1/f1.txt</Path>", game will look at /path_to_your_JA2/Data-your_mod/TableData/Laptop/X1/f1.txt

    AtInit: put 1 if you want to have this file from the game beginning, put 0 otherwise.
        To give this file to player during gameplay (AtInit=0), use LUA function "AddFilesToPlayersLog".

    Font: font handler, valid values are [0..25], inclusive. Current game code utilizes handlers as below, so any unused handler
        will run you into default font:
        0  - LARGEFONT1
        1  - SMALLFONT1
        2  - TINYFONT1
        3  - FONT12POINT1
        4  - CLOCKFONT  (not a human-readable font)
        5  - COMPFONT
        6  - SMALLCOMPFONT  (really small font)
        7  - FONT10ROMAN
        8  - FONT12ROMAN
        9  - FONT14SANSERIF
        10 - FONT10ARIAL
        11 - FONT14ARIAL
        12 - FONT10ARIALBOLD
        13 - FONT12ARIAL
        14 - BLOCKFONT
        15 - BLOCKFONT2
        16 - BLOCKFONT2  (yes, the same as 15)
        17 - FONT12ARIALFIXEDWIDTH
        18 - FONT16ARIAL
        19 - BLOCKFONTNARROW
        20 - FONT14HUMANIST

    TextColor: should be 8-bit RGB encoding of font color, bit schema is below. Please refer to Wikipedia for details.
        Bit    7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
        Data   R  R  R  G  G  G  B  B
        For example, byte bits "0000 0011" give pure blue color, and these bits are 3 in decimal.
        Sounds good? Yeah!
        
        But shitty shit called "color palette" is actually used instead, unfortunately. And this palette
        differs between actual fonts. Let's say, something 123 makes LARGEFONT1 be pink and makes BLOCKFONT2 be brown.
        Sad but true. Enjoy!
        
        Known colors:
        0 - black
        
    BkgdColor: absolutely same as TextColor, but makes background of your font be colored excepting 0, what makes
        background be white.
        Note: colored background may be a bit glitchy when rendered (depends on DDRAW DLL you use, I guess).
        
        Known colors:
        0 - white
