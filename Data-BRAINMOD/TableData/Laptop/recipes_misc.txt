   of ground with vegetation for creating a Ghillie Kit:
   Ghillie Kit Wood   = [Vegetation (Agaves) + Rubber Band]
   Ghillie Kit Wood   = [Vegetation (Grass) + Rubber Band]
   Ghillie Kit Desert = [Vegetation (Cactus) + Rubber Band]
   Ghillie Kit Desert = [Vegetation (D.Grass) + Rubber Band]

Fortification/entrenchment tips:

>> Use entrenchment tools (shovels, picks, hatchets etc) to
   dig dirt and deconstruct everything you see: debris,
   tires, sandbags and so on.

>> Combine Tires into a stack (3 pieces max) to construct a
   higher wall.

>> Morph construction materials one into another:
   Sandbag (med.) = [Sandbag (sm.) + Sandbag (sm.)]
   Sandbag (lar.) = [Sandbag (med.) + Wooden Planks (sm.)]
   Wooden Planks (med.)= [Wooden Planks (sm.) +
       Wooden Planks (sm.)]
   Wooden Planks (lar.)= [Wooden Planks (med.) +
       Wooden Planks (med.)]
   Wooden Wall (sm.) = [Wooden Planks (med.)  +  Nails]
   Wooden Wall (lar.)= [Wooden Planks (lar.)  +  Nails]
