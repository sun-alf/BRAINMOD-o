There is a few very simple good-to-know things for a person who is about to mix his stuff:

>>> A couple of severally used consumable kits or goods (fo-
    od, drinks, 1st aid kits etc) can be combined into one,
    re-filled.

>>> A pile of batteries can be split into lesser piles, or
    it can be merged with another pile. No more than 10
    units in one pile.

>>> The same way it works with ammunition, no matter what
    form of container it incapsulated in!

>>> Belts and LBE vests can be typically combined into one
    super-duper LBE vest. It works also with bandoleers.

>>> MOLLE vests, pouches and other parts are all about com-
    bining! Try and make whatever you dream about.

>>> Utility Knife is an useful tool indeed. Use it for hack-
    ing Trigger Groups and Beretta 93R.

>>> Yes, you can pour off gas from a gas tank into a gas
    drum!
