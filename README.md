# BRAINMOD for Original JA2 maps

Basically, it is AIMNAS mod tuned up to have more realistic game experience.
I had no idea on how to call this modding work, so I named it BRAINMOD what stands for "Basic Realism Adjustments Is Not a MOD". All TableData files were revisited to adopt the AIMNAS to Original maps.
Executable files are included.

#### Contents
Key features are:
* One tile is supposed to be around 4 meters, related parameters (effective range, loudness etc) of all weapons are adjusted to this axiom.
* NCTH parameters are adjusted to actual game program, there is no more "airsoft" auto-firing, only good shooters can do a precise shot from long dinstance and so on.
* Effects of bulletdrop are perceptible now.
* You cannot repair non-repairable items like helmets and bulletproof vests. (It is funny, but I just revealed it is AIMNAS default behavior)
* Settings of difficulty levels are adjusted so that random numbers will not make you frustrating anymore. The more difficult game mode is chosen, the more tight, tough and smart Queen's Army becomes.
* Queen's Army garrisons and patrols a revisited across the whole Arulco. Roads are patrolled, military and important objects are defended, while majority of town sectors are covered by police forces.
* Game starts during a night (4 AM), when most of Omerta guards are probably asleep, and this gives additional coverage of initial Landing Zone.
* Food system, diseases, Arulco Special Division and other Strategic Features are enabled and adjusted.
* You will never see zombies or Crepitus (Creatures) in this game.
* Spring&Rod upgrade is removed from the game (absurd), Barrel Extender (absurd) is now an improvised suppressor.
* Fortification (construct/deconstruct/drag sandbags, tires, wooden walls etc) is supported in all sectors.
* All suppressors have drawbacks -- reduced muzzle velocity costs accuracy and firepower.
* Fixes (for dozens of minor bugs) you probably will never see in original AIMNAS =)
